# Introduction
This script is designed to identify the primer set utilized for microbiome data obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The initial step in microbiome data analysis involves removing primer sequences. These primers are typically used to amplify desired regions of the 16S rRNA, and various primers may be employed for each experiment. To analyze data from multiple groups or institutions, it's essential to ascertain which primers were used for each dataset. Therefore, we coded a simple
script for this purpose.
